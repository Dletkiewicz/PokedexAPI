# PokedexAPI

A brief description of what this project does.

Pokedex is an electronic device created and designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game, anime and manga series. The Japanese name is simply "Pokémon Encyclopedia", as it can feature every Pokémon on it, depending on the Pokédex.
This application is connecting with local MySQL Database, so user can add pokemons to it.

In the future I will improve this application by adding Delete button, and giving more information about pokemons which are in Database.
